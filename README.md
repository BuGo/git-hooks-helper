My example pre-commit hook that i use myself.
To create such a hook type in console:
```
  cd your/project/
  touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
  chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
  vim .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
and paste following code:


```ruby
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  require "git-hooks-helper"

  GitHooksHelper.results do
    # fail/pass options
    # stop_on_warnings                                   # makes git commit fail if any warnings are found
    # never_stop                                         # hooks never fails commits
    # list_files                                         # shows list of all changed files
